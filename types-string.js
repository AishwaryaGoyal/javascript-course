const name = "Aishwarya";
const hello =
  "Hello. My name is " +
  name +
  ". I am trying concatenation using + operator and interpolation also.";
const helloBackTicks = `Hello. My name is ${name}. This is how we do it with back ticks. A lot easier no?`;

console.log(hello);
console.log(helloBackTicks);
