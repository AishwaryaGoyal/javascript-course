      Bringing to you. Aurora!
      Free-lance, traditional artist from India

      Hey there! I am Aishwarya/ Aurora. I love working in all mediums like watercolors, oil paints, acrylics, pencil colors, plain pencil or pen. I have been painting for 5 long years and I just love my work. Painting is like meditation and recreation for me. I like to delve deep into the intricacies and make realistic drawings, as much as I do simple cartoonish characters. Nowadays I am drawing more on the side of cartoons, kawaii and chibi. Take some time and explore my site to know more about me and my works.

      This is a painting of mine which is very close to my heart. I gave in all my skills and hardwork into it to make it as special as it is. A child sitting by a river, watching her hands and her reflection in water. I found the reference image as a photograph on pinterest and decided to convert it into painting. Main reasons behind my choice of reference were- I wanted to paint a subject which would be universal, which gives good feels to anyone, old or young, big or small when he sees it, and another reason that whatever it is I wanted that I donot get bored while making it. So yes, 1.5 months that I gave in to this work, I was totally involved in it, it kept my spirits up all the time. Its been 3 years since I made this painting. And all these years people have adored it.

      This painting is made in oil colors. Its canvas size is 2 by 2.5 ft. It took me an average of 64 hours to make it. Reference photography credits to Adrian C. Murray.

      I made this painting in the end of 2019. I call it "Beyond" due to its celestial theme. I have used the astrological elements of the Cancerian horoscope- moon and water. Along with that I have included some mountains and clouds. The girl in the picture is coming out of the waves taking form of water itself. Girl's reference is taken from pinterest. It took me 1 month to complete this painting. I worked during the weekdays for 2 hours every day on an average. This painting is completely made using oil colors. This is a video attached on the side that you see here. Go ahead and play it to get a zoomed-in view of the painting. The unframed size of this painting is 2*2.5 feet.

      Still another oil painting of mine which is again my favourite. A bicycle's basket full of flowers. Always loved the whole idea of this thing. I made this painting for spring festival, flowers blooming. You can tell from this how much I love riding bicycles. Reference image from our beloved Pinterest. Unframed canvas size is 1.5*2 feet.

      Colors mostly used---All colors possible!

      Haha. Just kidding. Yellows , Greens , Blues, Browns.
